 * Not actually a leetcode problem, but something I thought I should revise based on a Leetcode post.

 * A Union-Find is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets
 * (ones that don't overlap).
 * Applications include in Kruskal's Algorithm for minimum spanning trees, connected components
